            <h1>The Basics of Homology Theory</h1>
Algebraic topology is a field that seeks to establish 
correspondences between algebraic structures and topological
characteristics. It then uses results from algebra to infer
and uncover results about topology. It's a pretty powerful method.
</br></br>
Roughly speaking, AT provides two different frameworks for
characterizing topological spaces. These are <i>homotopy</i>
and <i>homology</i>. In this post, we'll start to take a look
at homology, which differs from homotopy in that it's less
powerful in some senses, but significantly easier to work with
and compute which endows it with a different sort of power.
</br></br>
<h2>Some Definitions to Start</h2>
<b><u>Definition</u></b> Say we're working in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The <i>$p$-simplex</i>, defined for $p \leq n$, is
$$\Delta_p := \left\{x = \sum_{i=0}^p \lambda_i e_i \mid \sum_{i=0}^p \lambda_i\ = 1, \lambda_i \geq 0\right\}$$
$\Delta_p$ is a generalization of the triangle to $p$ dimensions. Now, there are actually two types of homology
which have developed in the annals of mathematics.
The first of these is <i>singular homology</i>, which concerns
itself with the study of topological spaces via the mapping of
simplices into these spaces. The other type is called
<i>Cech homology</i> which handles the study of topology via
the approximation of topological spaces with spaces of a certain
class, namely those which admit a triangulation. Of these two
branches of homology, singular is by far the more prevalent in
the literature and is the one we'll delve into here.
</br></br>
Given a triangular polytope like we've defined in $\Delta_p$,
one operation we might like to consider is using that region
as a way to sort of define regions of interest around not just
basis vectors, but any arbitrary collection of vectors in the space. Given such a set $\{v_0, \ldots, v_p\}$ we can denote
by $[v_0, \ldots, v_p]$ the mapping of $\Delta_p \to \mathbb{R}^n$ defined by
$$\sum_{i=0}^p \lambda_i e_i \to \sum_{i=0}^p \lambda_i v_i$$
What this gives us from an intuitive perspective is the simplex
expanded or shrunken to cover the span of the $v_i$. One nice
property of this map is that its image is convex. We call the
resulting simplex the <i>affine p-simplex</i>, and we sometimes
refer to the $\lambda_i$ in this context as <i>barycentric coordinates</i>.
</br></br>
In addition to mapping between simplices and sets of vectors,
we'd like to define a way to map between a $p$-simplex and a
($p + 1$)-simplex and vice versa. The mapping from
$p$ to $p + 1$ is called the $i$th face map and is notated
as
$$F_i^{p+1} : \Delta_p \to \Delta_{p + 1}$$
It is formed by deleting the $i$th vertex in dimension
$p + 1$. To notate this, we can write $[e_0, \ldots, \hat{e_i}
, \ldots, e_{p+1}]$ where the hat indicates that $e_i$ is
omitted. This face map is so named because it embeds the
$p$-simplex in the $p+1$-simplex as the face opposite $e_i$, the
vertex that's being deleted.
</br></br>
<b><u>Definition</u></b> For a topological space $X$, a <i>
singular $p$-simplex</i> of $X$ is simply a continuous function
$\sigma_p : \Delta_p \to X$.
</br></br>
<div align="middle">
	<img src="/images/singular2simplex.png"></img>
	<p>The singular 2-simplex, mapping from the standard 2-simplex to $X$.</p>
</div>
Basically, our goal in defining the singular $p$-simplices is
to provide a sort of "basis" for the triangulation of an 
arbitrary topological space. In this way, the singular $p$-simplex gives us a way to cover some patch of $X$ with 
a triangle-like region. Accordingly, we can define a group
which in some sense acts like a vector space of these triangular
basis regions. By allowing the linear combination of maps on 
these elements, we can give entire triangulations of the space
$X$. 
</br></br>
<b><u>Definition</u></b> The <i>singular p-chain group
$\Delta_p(X)$</i> is the free abelian group that's generated by the singular $p$-simplices.
</br></br>
In more concrete terms, the elements of $\Delta_p(X)$ are called
$p$-chains and are simply linear combinations
$$c = \sum_\sigma n_\sigma \sigma$$ of $p$-simplices with
coefficients $n_\sigma$ coming from some ring (usually the
integers).
</br></br>
We can recover how the singular $p$-simplex maps the faces of
$\Delta_p$ to $X$ by simply composing the map $\sigma$ with the
face map $F_i^p$. This is called the <i>ith face of $\sigma$</i>
and is written
$$\sigma^{(i)} = \sigma \circ F_i^p$$

For a given singular $p$-simplex $\sigma$, we can defined a $(p-1)$-chain that gives the <i>boundary</i> of $\sigma$ as
$$\partial_p \sigma = \sum_{i=0}^p (-1)^i \sigma_p^{(i)}$$

The boundary operator extends to chains in the natural way, by distributing over addition, $\partial_p c = \partial_p (\sum_\sigma n_\sigma \sigma) = \sum_\sigma n_\sigma \partial_p
\sigma$. This law, in fact, makes $\partial_p$ into a 
homomorphism of groups
$$\partial_p : \Delta_p(X) \to \Delta_{p-1}(X)$$ 
Now, we introduce a key fact about the boundary operator that
will allow us to define homology groups. You should be well
aware of the saying "the enemy of my enemy is my friend".
Well, in algebraic topology boundaries are our enemies and
we have a similar statement, "the boundary of my boundary is
a loser (zero)". In other words, for any $\sigma$,
$$\partial_p(\partial_{p + 1} \sigma) = 0$$
I'll skip the proof for this because it's just a really nasty
rearrangement of a complicated sum, but if you're truly
interested you can find it in pretty much any algebraic 
topology textbook.
</br></br>
We call $im(\partial_{p+1}) = B_{p}(X)$ the
<i>boundary group</i> and $ker(\partial_p) = Z_p(X)$ the
<i>cycle group</i>. 
Note that the above identity implies that $im(\partial_{p + 1})$ is a subgroup of $ker(\partial_p)$ which is equivalent
to saying $B_p(C) \leq Z_p(C)$. 
</br></br>
<h2>The Homology Group</h2>
We define the $p$th <i>homology group</i> as the quotient
$$H_p(X) := Z_p(X) / B_p(X)$$
In other words, this is the group of cycles modded out by
the group of boundaries. To give a rough intuition, the
rank of $H_p(X)$ tells us the number of $p$-dimensional
"holes" contained in $X$. You can think about it as follows.
If each cycle in $X$ is equivalent to some boundary, then
those boundaries have no "interior" excisions. However, if a
hole does exist, then there will be some discrepancy between
boundaries and cycles, and the number of such discrepancies
(holes) will be given by the rank of $H_p(X)$.
