  <h4>Natural Language Generative Models for Program Synthesis</h4>
  <h5>Under Development</h5>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li><b>Description:</b> I am working with fellow students in the EECS department
  on training LSTMs and other deep models to generate working Python code from natural
  language descriptions of programming tasks. This is a class project for CS 294-131:
  Special Topics in Deep Learning and is under active development.</li>
  <li><b>Relevant Technologies/Skills:</b> Python 3, Tensorflow, Keras, Deep Learning
  </li></ul>
  <h4>Retina - Google Summer of Code</h4>
  <a href="https://github.com/mcneela/Retina">View on Github</a>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li><b>Description:</b> I participated in Google Summer of Code
  from June - August 2016, and built out a suite of scientific
  visualization tools called <b>Fovea</b>. The new project is called
  <b>Retina</b> and is hosted on my Github. If you're interested in
  creating dynamic, interactive visualizations using Matplotlib or Plotly then check it out! For those interested, you can view my
  accepted project proposal <a href="proposal.pdf">here</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Relevant Technologies/Skills:</b> Python 3, Javascript, Jupyter, Git, Matplotlib, Plotly, OOP, Code Refactoring and Design, Machine Learning, Scientific Visualization</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Machine Learning Tutorials</h4>
  <h5>Under Development</h5>
  <a href="https://github.com/mcneela/MachineLearningTutorials">View on Github</a>
  <ul type="disc">
  <li><b>Description:</b> A series of tutorials on Machine Learning that I'm putting together, to be complemented by blog posts
  on this site. So far all tutorials are self-contained entities in Jupyter Notebooks. Support for languages other than Python
  may be added at a future date. Feel free to clone the repo and run the tutorials as you read through the posts on this site!
  I hope to update and add more tutorials on a fairly regular basis.</li>
  <li><b>Relevant Technologies/Skills:</b>Python 3, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter, Matplotlib, Pandas, Machine Learning</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Chip-8 Python Emulator</h4>
  <a href="https://github.com/mcneela/chip8">View on Github</a>
  <ul type="disc">
	<li><b>Description:</b> An emulator of the Chip-8 virtual machine run on some of the very first personal
computers such as the Cosmac VIP and Telmac 1800.</li>
	<li><b>Relevant Technologies/Skills:</b> Python 3, Basic Computer Architecture Knowledge</li>
  </ul>
<!--   <h4>MATErix: A Matrix Algebra Calculator</h4>
  <a href="https://github.com/mcneela/MATErix">View on Github</a>
  <ul type="disc">
	<li><b>Description:</b> A robust application and extensible library for the solving of computational linear algebra problems. Supports advanced algorithms for various operations such as the Strassen algorithm for the multiplication of large matrices.</li>
