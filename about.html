<h1>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p>I am a software engineer specializing in data science and machine learning. In May 2017, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with my bachelor's degree in applied mathematics.
I currently work at <a href="http://humanlongevity.com">Human
Longevity, Inc.</a> where I work on creating machine learning
algorithms and scalable data processing pipelines for genomics
with a particular focus on oncology.
I previously had the pleasure of working at <a href="http://machinevantage.com">machineVantage</a> as a Machine Learning Researcher where I focused on deep learning algorithm development for natural language processing.
A complete listing of my current and completed coursework can be found in my <a href="resume/website_resume.pdf">resume</a>. I am interested in a wide spectrum of topics from a diverse set of fields including 
statistics, computational neuroscience, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and linguistics. I regularly blog about interesting topics in both 
<a href="math.html">mathematics</a> and <a href="compsci.html">computer science</a>, and you can view my coding portfolio <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>.

In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy writing creative fiction and reading great books. The <a href="books.html">books</a> page hosts an application that pulls from my Goodreads feed and continuously aggregates the novels that I am in the process of reading. I also enjoy running, biking, playing guitar/piano, and writing music.
